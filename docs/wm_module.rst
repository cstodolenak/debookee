Wi-Fi Monitoring (WM) Module
############################

The Wi-Fi Monitoring module puts your Wi-Fi network interface in monitoring mode and listens to all 802.11 radio frames around.

You'll see not only Access Points, but also all Wi-Fi clients in your radio range, if they're associated or not, and details on their connection.

Debookee WM module shows bidirectional infos for each client connection: from AP to client and client to AP (Data Rate, %Retries, %Errors ...)
