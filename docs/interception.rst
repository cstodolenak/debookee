Traffic Interception (MITM)
###########################

The Network Analysis module Debookee is able to intercept and monitor the traffic of any device in the same subnet, thanks to a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).

It allows you to capture data from mobile devices on your Mac (iPhone, iPad, Android, BlackBerry...) or Printer, TV, Fridge (Internet of Things!) without the need of a proxy.

This interception is done in 1 clic and is totally transparent, without network interruption.
